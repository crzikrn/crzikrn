### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm a Creative Technologist. I'm also a Product Designer who loves to dabble in code. I love p5js and have created sites with Reactjs, Astro, and threejs hosting on Vercel.


I started coding with processing and have created various Computer Vision projects with p5js.

As a Product Designer, I love learning new Web Development tools. Currently, learning Astro and Tailwind CSS.
