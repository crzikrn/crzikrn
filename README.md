### Hi there 👋

# I'm a Creative Technologist and [Product/Brand Designer](https://michaelkbyun.com) who loves to dabble in code. I love p5js and have created sites with Reactjs, Astro, and threejs hosting on Vercel.

## About me

* 🐣 I started coding with processing and have created various Computer Vision projects with p5js.
* 💿 As a Product Designer, I love learning new Web Development tools.
* 🌱 I'm currently learning Astro and Tailwind CSS. With that said, I feel Flexbox solves most design issues on the browser.
* 💀 I'm back in the coding scene because these days it seems being a generalist is awesome.

## Tools
* 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on creating web experiences and games!
* 🧰 Other tools I use in my trade are _Figma_, _Blender3D_, _After Effects_, and the occasional _Photoshop_+_Illustrator_ Combo.
